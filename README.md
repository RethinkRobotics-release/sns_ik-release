*SNS IKL*
Version 0.2.1 beta

The Inverse Kinematic Library (*SNS IKL*) contains tools to invert the differential kinematic of a robot (this version is tested only on fixed base manipulator).
The methods implemented on the IKL are:
- STD          the standard pseudoinversion of the jacobian
- SCALE        pseudoinversion with task scaling to satisfy joint constraints
- SNS          the SNS algorithm which permits to consider hard constraints at joint level

All this methods permits to solve the inversion of the kinematic of a prioritized stack of task. (note that only the SNS algorithm guarantees to satisfy all joint constraints).
